// Who sees what without signing in. Signed out, a visitor can read the
// curated example reports (examples.ts) in full and a teaser of any other
// report: the verdict, the odds and one number, with the rest behind sign-in.
// Find, Browse and the Hacktoberfest page are open: their lists come from
// what Holt has already checked, and every card leads to a report (so, signed
// out, to its teaser). Opening a report with no result yet runs the free
// check (anon-check.ts: the report page only, rate-limited per IP, never for
// bots); anything else that starts a check or a search needs an account, and
// so do Compare, pre-flight, the dashboard and settings (ACCOUNT_PAGES):
// arriving signed out goes to sign-in and back.
// The browser extension's public API (/api/public/*) reads the cache and
// stays open. No runtime imports, so it runs under `node --test` and in the browser.
