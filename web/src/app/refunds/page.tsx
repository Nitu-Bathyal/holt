        <p><strong>The short version.</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>A pass is one payment. It doesn&rsquo;t renew, so there&rsquo;s nothing to cancel.</li>
          <li>Full refund within 3 days if the pass is unused: no merge plan made and no alert sent. Non-refundable once used.</li>
          <li>Approved refunds go back to the original payment method within 5 to 7 business days.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>1. What this covers</h2>
      <p>
        This policy applies to anything you pay Holt for. Payments appear as <strong>{PAYMENT_BRAND}</strong> on your statement.
        Rupee payments are processed by Razorpay; dollar payments are processed by Dodo Payments, which is the merchant of record
        for those purchases. Rules reports, finding and comparing projects, and the free AI reports
        are free and are not covered here.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Passes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>One payment, no renewal.</strong> A pass gives Pro for the period shown when you buy it (1, 3 or 12 months). It ends on its own and is never charged again, so there&rsquo;s nothing to cancel.</li>
        <li><strong>Refundable within 3 days if unused.</strong> If you bought a pass by mistake or changed your mind, email us within 3 days of the purchase. As long as the pass hasn&rsquo;t been used (no merge plan made and no alert sent), we&rsquo;ll refund the full amount.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-refundable once used.</strong> Once a pass has been used, it can&rsquo;t be refunded, in whole or in part, including for the days left. The exceptions are where the law requires a refund, and failed or duplicate charges (see section 3).</li>
        <li>A pass has no cash value and can&rsquo;t be transferred to another account.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Failed and duplicate charges</h2>
      <p>
        If you were charged but didn&rsquo;t receive what you paid for, or were charged twice for the same thing, we&rsquo;ll refund the
        extra charge in full. Send us the payment IDs and we&rsquo;ll sort it out.
      </p>

      <h2>4. How to ask for a refund</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Email <ContactEmail /> from the email address on your Holt account.</li>
        <li>Include the <strong>payment ID</strong>. It&rsquo;s on the receipt email from Razorpay or Dodo Payments (for Razorpay it starts with <code>pay_</code>).</li>
        <li>Say what you bought and why you&rsquo;re asking for a refund. A line is enough.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>We aim to reply within 3 business days. If we need anything else to check the payment, we&rsquo;ll ask.</p>

      <h2>5. How refunds are paid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Approved refunds go to the <strong>original payment method</strong>, in the currency you were charged in.</li>
        <li>We issue the refund through the processor within <strong>5 to 7 business days</strong> of approving it. Your bank or card issuer may take a few more days to show it.</li>
        <li>We refund the amount you paid us. Currency-conversion differences or fees charged by your bank aren&rsquo;t something we can return.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Disputes and chargebacks</h2>
      <p>
        If something is wrong, please email us first: a refund is faster than a dispute. If you do open a dispute or chargeback,
        it is handled under the rules of the processor that took the payment, Razorpay or Dodo Payments, and their decision is
        followed. We&rsquo;ll provide the payment records they ask for.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Changes to this policy</h2>
