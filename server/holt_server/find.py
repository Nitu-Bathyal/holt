"""Find answers from Holt's own index first, then from a GitHub search.

    POST /v1/find {"languages": [...], "topics": [...], "hacktoberfest": true, "days": 7}

The **index** is every repository with a current-engine 7-day **rules**
report (what Discover reads, discover.py): those whose verdict is "Worth your
time", matching the filters through `repo_meta`, ranked like Discover's
welcoming board. It is read from the database only, so it answers at once
and costs nothing:

* languages: the repo's main language, or its second when that is a real
  share of the code (`repo_meta.languages`); any one of the picked languages.
* topics: any one of the picked topics; `hacktoberfest` adds the
  `hacktoberfest` topic as a requirement, as the search does.
* archived repos and forks are left out (the search leaves them out too); a
  repo closed to outside pull requests already is by its verdict.
* the maintainers' typical first reply must fit in the time picked (`days`),
  the same line the verdict draws for "too slow for the time you have".
* it must have starter issues Holt knows about (`starter_cache`, at most
  `discover.STARTER_MAX_HOURS` old): a repo whose known issues are none, or
  unknown yet, isn't listed. They are the ones a Discover card carries.

The **search** is the GitHub search `holt.starter.find` runs (jobs.py, cached
6 h per search in `find_cache`). A search job also reads the starter issues
of the first `FILL_ISSUES` index matches that have none known yet, so they
join the list when it finishes.

Results are the index first, then the search's repos that aren't already
there. While a search runs, `/v1/find` answers 202 with the index part in
`results`; its `done` event, and a cached search, carry both. When the caller
is over their work limit the index part is the answer, marked `complete:
false`.

The index part is the same for everyone who picks the same filters, so it is
built once and kept (cache.py) until this process writes a report, a repo's
details or its starter issues, `INDEX_KEPT_S` at most. Who is asking, their
limits and the search itself are never kept here.

    POST /v1/find/index {"languages": [...], ..., "limit": 24, "cursor": <next>}

The rest of the index part, for a list that loads more as it is scrolled: the
same matches in the same order, `limit` at a time, with `total` and `next`
(discover.py's cursor). It reads the kept index only: it never starts a
search, calls GitHub or counts against anyone's limit.
