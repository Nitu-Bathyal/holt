"""Read a repository's details (language, stars, topics...) right after its
report is stored, so a repo checked for the first time shows up on Discover,
the Hacktoberfest row and its card complete, without waiting for the warm pass.

Best effort, after the report: the job is already done and its subscribers
told before anything here runs, and a failure is only logged. Reports that
finish within `DELAY_S` of each other share one query (up to a hundred repos,
about a point). A repo whose details are younger than
discover.META_MAX_AGE_HOURS is not read again; the daily meta-only warm pass
(`deploy/prod/warm-meta.sh`) keeps the rest fresh.

The report job itself doesn't read topics, so this is a separate query rather
than something copied out of the report.
