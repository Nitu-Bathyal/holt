"""Account emails: who gets which, once each (API.md, "Account emails").

Five emails, and no more:

- `welcome`: once per account, at its first sign-in;
- `receipt`: for each paid pass. It always goes out;
- `trial_ending`: `TRIAL_WARN` before the free days of PR alerts end, and
  `trial_ended`: once when they have, for someone whose alerts were on;
- `pass_ending`: `PASS_WARN` before a paid pass ends (passes don't renew).

Off unless `HOLT_ACCOUNT_EMAILS=1`, and nothing is sent without the mailer
(`RESEND_API_KEY`, mailer.py). The address is the one the user signed in with:
`web/` reports it at each sign-in (`POST /v1/me/sign-in`), and until it has,
the alert settings' address, which is the same one, stands in. Nobody types
an address here.

Every email but the receipt respects one switch, `account_mail.product_on`:
on by default, turned off by the email's "Stop these emails" link and its
one-click header, with the token mechanism alert emails use (the same web
page and route take both kinds of token).

`account_emails` is the sent-log. A send first claims its (user, key) row,
which is unique, so each email goes out once however many runs, requests and
processes find it due. A claim the provider couldn't take is given back and
tried again on a later run.

`run` sends what is due. It runs every `EVERY_S` in the API process, and at
once after a first sign-in or a paid order (`kick`). Account emails count
against the same daily limit as alert emails; a receipt may use the few sends
the others keep in hand.

    python -m holt_server.account_mail                      # one run now
    python -m holt_server.account_mail samples <user id>    # see `send_samples`
