"""The response bodies in API.md, as pydantic models.

These are the contract with `web/` and the browser extension: the OpenAPI
document FastAPI builds from them is turned into `web/src/lib/api-schema.ts`
(`server/scripts/api_types.sh`), and CI fails when that file is stale.

What a reader sees at the top of a report (the headline and its tone, then
three lines: the reason, the numbers with their dates, what to do next) and
"How this was counted" are derived here, once, from the verdict, the counts
and the rules. Every surface renders these fields instead of working them out
again, so they cannot disagree with each other or with the verdict. They are
computed fields, so reports cached before a wording change get the new wording.

Adding a field: give it a default (reports already in the cache were stored
without it), add it to API.md, and regenerate the TypeScript types.
