"""Recommendations for you: `GET /v1/me/recommendations` (API.md).

A short list of repositories, with starter issues, picked for one signed-in
user. Every step is a rule over data Holt already has; no model is asked and
GitHub is never called while the page is served:

* **Candidates** are the repositories whose latest 7-day **rules** report says
  "Worth your time" (checked within `REPORT_MAX_DAYS`), plus viable results of
  recent finds (`find_cache`) Holt has no report for; reports and finds from an
  older engine version don't count. Maintainers must still
  be answering: a median first reply within `REPLY_MAX_HOURS` and at most
  `SILENT_MAX` of outside pull requests left without one. Archived repos and
  forks are left out, and so is every repository the user already sent a pull
  request to (My Contributions) or owns.
* **Matching** uses what the user told us (profile languages and topics) and
  what they did (the languages of repositories where their pull requests were
  merged, for connected users). A repository must match at least one of them.
* **Ranking** adds up fixed points (`POINTS`): a stated language, a language
  they've been merged in, each shared topic, the odds, first-timers merged
  (for a newcomer) and fitting starter issues. Ties go to the Discover order
  (merged share, reply time, sample).
* **Issues** come from `starter_cache` (or the find result): a newcomer sees
  only issues labelled for first-timers, and a repository whose known issues
  have none is dropped; issues matching the user's contribution types first.

The inputs are refreshed elsewhere: reports and starter issues by the warm
pass, repository details daily (discover.py), a connected user's pull
requests daily (contributions.py). So the list is computed per request, from
the database only, and moves as those do.

Recommendations are a paid feature (`recommendations` in pricing.json): a
plan that covers it shows every pick; everyone else gets the first
`FREE_PICKS` and a count of the rest. Viewing is never charged.
