# warm-meta.sh -- re-read the repository details Discover shows (language,
# stars, topics, archived) for every reported repo whose copy is a day old.
# install.sh schedules it daily at 05:00 UTC (holt-prod-warm-meta.timer);
# by hand: deploy/prod/warm-meta.sh. Log: $STATE/logs/warm-meta.log.
#
# The warm pass with everything but details off (`--no-reports --no-starter
# --no-find`), in the foreground, in a one-off container of the live server
# image. It works no jobs, so it never takes a person's analysis. Cost: about
# one GitHub GraphQL point per hundred repos, and it stops below
# HOLT_WARM_MIN_POINTS (1500) left; the summary line says how many it used.
# A repo's first report already reads its own details (meta_refresh.py), so a
# skipped day only means some stars are a day older.
#
# Never overlaps:
#   - a deploy: it holds deploy.sh's lock ($STATE/lock) while it runs, and
#     waits up to HOLT_META_LOCK_WAIT seconds (45 min) for a deploy to finish,
#     else skips the day. A deploy that starts meanwhile exits 75 (busy) and
#     follow.sh tries again two minutes later; the pass takes seconds.
#   - the nightly backup: 03:30 UTC, and both take $STATE/backup.lock.
#   - a full warm pass: the pass's own advisory lock; it exits 75 and is
#     logged as skipped.
#
# The timer runs the copy in $STATE/bin (install.sh), with the compose file
# and env.sh of the deployed commit ($STATE/src), like the live stack.
# Rehearsal: HOLT_PROD_PROJECT and HOLT_PROD_HOME as for deploy.sh (README.md).
